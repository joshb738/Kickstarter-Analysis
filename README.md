### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

1. Based on the analysis of  the **Outcomes based on Launch Date** we can determine that 
   - Approximately 61% of theatre kickstarter campagigns launched during 2009 - 2017 were successful in meeting their pledged goal. 
   - Approximately 35% of successful theatre kickstarters are launched during the months of May- July. 

2. Upon further analysis of **Outcomes based on Goals** for Theatres, we can conclude that the majority of play kickstarters set a funding goal of $5000 or less and have achieved a 75% success rate.  

3. What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
