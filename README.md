### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

a) Based on the analysis of  the **Outcomes based on Launch Date** we can determine that 
  - Approximately 61% of theatre kickstarter campagigns launched during 2009 - 2017 were successful in meeting their pledged goal. 
  - Approximately 35% of successful theatre kickstarters are launched during the months of May- July. 

- Upon further analysis of Outcomes based on Goals for Theatres, we can conclude that the majority of play kickstarters have 75% success rate of achieving their goal of $5000 or less. Pledges from ranging from the $20000 to $35000 have a higher failure rate. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
