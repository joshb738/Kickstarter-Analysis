### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

1. Based on the analysis of  the **Outcomes based on Launch Date** we can determine the following:
   - Approximately 61% of theatre kickstarter campaigns launched during 2009 - 2017 were successful in meeting their pledged goal. 
   - Approximately 35% of successful theatre kickstarters are launched during the months of May- July. 
  
2. Upon further analysis of **Outcomes based on Goals** for Theatres, we can conclude that 75% of play kickstarters with a funding goal of $5000 or less have successfully ahcieved their goal. 

3. What are some limitations of this dataset?

4. What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
